Project Overview:
--------
The goal for this project is to provide a machine learning solution for building managers to monitor their building performance and 
potentially increase the building energy efficiency.

Project Detail:
--------
We have implemented the basic machine learning model to predict the expected building energy efficiency, as well as a website for the 
building managers to upload and predict their building energy data. <br />
Due to limited resource, we were not able to make an energy optimization 
solution using deep reinforcement learning. (for example, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.05196.pdf)

The project can be broken into three major parts
